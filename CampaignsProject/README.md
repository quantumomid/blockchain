# Campaigner DApp App

A Next.js application that allows users to create new campaigns, as well as contribute to existing ones, and then vote on approving requests on said campaigns. 

In essence the application was thought to provide a more secure method for inventors to gain funding for their projects. The inventor could create a new campaign and interested parties online can then contribute to that campaign. 

The inventor can then make requests for withdrawing funds from the campaign pool fund which the majority of contributors will have to approve. This prevents abuse of the funds by malicous parties.
